Hi there. Thanks for opening the opportunity which is pretty appealing for the full stack developers who have relevant experiences.

I am very excited to see this one as I strongly believe this could be the chance to dedicate myself heavily to reuse my practical experience.

As for myself, I have been working as a senior fullstack software engineer for more than 6 years and have helped many startups to build web portals for their businesses.



What I think that is most relevant to your business is the one that i have developed is the smilemarketing.com

For this project, I have create a portal where agencies can expose their services and manage & communicate with their clients effectively.

In technical aspects, I have used Node/Express, React, AWS microservices, Stripe, Gitlab and Oauth2 was used for authentication stuff.

For the long-term goal, it is pretty important to focus on scalability and that's why we have leveraged AWS microservice softwares.



So this hands-on experience makes me stand out and gives me an edge over the others when it comes to micro-service-based architecture.

I strongly believe that I could be one of the promising and productive candidate for your specific project as I have all qualities that could be the great asset for the team and the business.

Look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards.

What challenging part of this job are you most experienced in?
One of the most important factor for almost all software products is maintainability and scalability ,

Hi Vera
Your description totally makes sense and it is well-received by me.

As far as I understand, there are 3 main characters here, companies, users and vacancies
And each companies, users and vacancies will have status such as active, disabled, waiting for review etc, I guess
Users can search, filter and apply to the companies. They can purchase membership etc...

To build admin panel for this project successfully, the most important things to consider are security and performance, I believe

As an experienced front-end engineer, I have rich experience in React programming and my experience covers most of fields.
I have ever built job boards and this pracitical experience will surely give me an edge over the others as I have faced many use-cases and overcame them successfully.

What I cared when I am building the job boards are the performance and security
When there are a lot of data, I should use virtualizing or other beneficial technologies
And when it comes to security, as this is a financial platform, we should check the request validity seriously and thoroughly

Apart from them, I have a few questions or suggestions
1) Seems like you are requiring an admin panel built. If so, could you let me know what technologies you have used for users panel? Because I strongly believe that syncing libraries across the projects are important.
2) Do you offer backend APIs for me ?
To sort, filter and display users&companies in tables, the common and best practice for frontend is to just display them from the response that backend sorted, filtered etc...

Anyway I am very confiident that I can successfully build this project in 2~3 weeks, and if this time-line makes sense, please feel free to contact me over a chat
Regards.

1) It often draws unnecessary grey verticial lines when I drag.

But in desktop, I can't drag to the most right.

The core modules it has used are React 16.12, redux-thunk and react-bootstrap.
And for routing, current project has used normal react-router.

I have rich practical experience with all of the modules it has used.
As soon as you share JSON file for routing, I can make a reusable component which deals with routing efficiently
I can leverage lazy-loading ( https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html#reactlazy ) to insure better performance and faster loading speed than normal routing.

As I am a veteran in React development, I can understand and enhance the existing React project so quickly while ensuring best performance with maintainable codebase.

If you could share your requirements in more detail with the JSON file, it would be nice.
Thank you.

Hi Leonard
Thanks for sharing your concern.

I have read the requirements and I am reaching out to you with a great interest !
As far as I understood, to be a god candidate for this role, it is important to be familiar with AWS services and to have got experience with React and Material UI.

I have been serving as a full-stack developer for more than 6 years and used several leading softwares in this industry.
I have ever used various AWS services and I am extremely familiar with them such as AWS Lambda, Gateway, DynamoDB, S3, Cognito, SSO and more..
As I am a veteran in React + MUI, I strongly believe that I could fill the role.

If you could give me more brief information about the project such as

1) What library does it use for global state management? ( Redux, Mobx etc )
2) How do you mark the percentage of completion of current project?
3) What software do you use for designing or prototyping wireframes ?

it would be highly appreciated !
Look forward to your response.
Regards.

Jhonny A.
