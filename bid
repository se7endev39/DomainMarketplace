Meeting ID: 765 4632 2541
Passcode: PgHs8b

I am a React Native developer with experience in building performant mobile apps on both the iOS(mobile operating system ) and Android platforms. 
I am responsible for architecting and building these applications, as well as coordinating with the teams responsible for other layers of the product infrastructure
I think the candidate needs to have rich hands-on experience in React-native development and to be all rounded with various libraries.


In my previous works, I was mainly worked on the frontend react-native side.

I have converted Figma designs into reusable components hundreds of times.
So I am pretty productive and deliverables are always a pixel-perfect match with the design while being fully responsive in all major devices with great user experience.


Responsibilities

-I can build pixel-perfect, buttery smooth UIs across both mobile platforms.
I can leverage native APIs for deep integrations with both platforms.
- I can diagnose and fix bugs and performance bottlenecks for performance that feels native.
- I can reach out to the open-source community to encourage and help implement mission-critical software fixes—React Native moves fast and often breaks things.
- I can maintain code and write automated tests to ensure the product is of the highest quality.
- I can transition existing React web apps to React Native.

Skills

- I have a firm grasp of JavaScript, including ES6+ syntax
- I have the ability to write well-documented, clean Javascript code
- I have rock solid at working with third-party dependencies and debugging dependency conflicts
- I have a familiarity with native build tools, like XCode, Gradle 
- Understanding of REST APIs, the document request model, and offline storage

As you can see in my profile,
I have been serving as a full-stack developer for more than 6 years.

I am super talented in using styled-components to build pixel-perfect and responsive pages with media queries, assigning javascript variables to CSS, etc.

As a front-end developer, I have experience with Scrum/Agile methodology and I am familiar with Trello, Jira, Bitbucket, and Github

Hi there. Thanks for opening the opportunity which is pretty appealing for the full stack developers who have relevant experiences.

I am very excited to see this one as I strongly believe this could be the chance to dedicate myself heavily to reuse my practical experience.

As for myself, I have been working as a senior fullstack software engineer for more than 6 years and have helped many startups to build web portals for their businesses.



What I think that is most relevant to your business is the one that i have developed is the smilemarketing.com

For this project, I have create a portal where agencies can expose their services and manage & communicate with their clients effectively.

In technical aspects, I have used Node/Express, React, AWS microservices, Stripe, Gitlab and Oauth2 was used for authentication stuff.

For the long-term goal, it is pretty important to focus on scalability and that's why we have leveraged AWS microservice softwares.



So this hands-on experience makes me stand out and gives me an edge over the others when it comes to micro-service-based architecture.

I strongly believe that I could be one of the promising and productive candidate for your specific project as I have all qualities that could be the great asset for the team and the business.

Look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards.

What challenging part of this job are you most experienced in?
One of the most important factor for almost all software products is maintainability and scalability ,
These factors are guranteed by clean project structure and code quality.

What part of this project most appeals to you?

Hi Vera
Your description totally makes sense and it is well-received by me.

As far as I understand, there are 3 main characters here, companies, users and vacancies
And each companies, users and vacancies will have status such as active, disabled, waiting for review etc, I guess
Users can search, filter and apply to the companies. They can purchase membership etc...

To build admin panel for this project successfully, the most important things to consider are security and performance, I believe

As an experienced front-end engineer, I have rich experience in React programming and my experience covers most of fields.
I have ever built job boards and this pracitical experience will surely give me an edge over the others as I have faced many use-cases and overcame them successfully.

What I cared when I am building the job boards are the performance and security
When there are a lot of data, I should use virtualizing or other beneficial technologies
And when it comes to security, as this is a financial platform, we should check the request validity seriously and thoroughly

Apart from them, I have a few questions or suggestions
1) Seems like you are requiring an admin panel built. If so, could you let me know what technologies you have used for users panel? Because I strongly believe that syncing libraries across the projects are important.
2) Do you offer backend APIs for me ?
To sort, filter and display users&companies in tables, the common and best practice for frontend is to just display them from the response that backend sorted, filtered etc...

Anyway I am very confiident that I can successfully build this project in 2~3 weeks, and if this time-line makes sense, please feel free to contact me over a chat
Regards.

Hi Victor
I have read the description about the responsibilities and qualifications needed.
As an experienced ReactJS Developer with over 4 years of practical experience, I am very interested in this position.

While reading the description, I understood that to be a great candidate for this position, it is important to create and follow best practices and standard styleguide, write clean and maintainable code.
These are what I am especially strong at.
I highly prioritize performance and maintainability of the project I structure and the code I write.
So that's why all of previous projects are easily maintainable, scalable and modular.

Another thing I have found as important is to have got eyes for sleek UI/UX.
UI/UX is one of the most important factor that makes the product stand out.
I have got razor-sharp eye for the details and I always take care of great UI/UX to increase conversion rating.

Have ever structured MVC using Node/Express, built visualized analytics admin dashboard with fellow engineers, QA, designers, and product manager.

I have been working remotely for more than 4 years and I am familiar with Scrum/Agile methodology, JIRA, CI/CD, Github, Bitbucket, Figma,  so I am sure that I can role as a team player very well.

I look forward to an opportunity to dedicate my experience with the growing innovative team, and I strongly believe you are.
Look forward to hearing from you.

I have played with image slider for minutes and I have found some issues there.

1) It often draws unnecessary grey verticial lines when I drag.

2) In mobile, I am able to drag the vertical slider to the very end of the both left and right side.
But in desktop, I can't drag to the most right.

3) While playing in mobile, there was also a weird issue.
See how you can reproduce this issue.
I was gonna change the position of vertical slider in the single card by dragging the screen but it accidently changed the whole slider.

I feel confident to fix above issues soon and look forward to hearing more details from you.

Regards.

Dear Arbitrage Team.

Thanks for sharing concern.
While reading through the requirements, I found me as a good candidate for this role.
To be successful in this role, I think the candidate needs to have rich hands-on experience in React development and to be all rounded with various libraries.

What makes me stand out is that I have solid understanding in React programming.
Very familiar with the libraries such as React-redux, redux-saga, redux-thunk, styled-components, Material UI, AntD, React Router v4, v5, reselect,and more.
I wirte clean code by implementing best practices which ensures high performance and maintainability as well.
As I have got rich experience with JS ES6(ECMAScript2015 ~ ECMAScript2018) and TypeScript, I truely feel that I am a perfect candidate.

As soon as you give me the assessment, I will accomplish it very soon.
Regards.

Hello.
Thanks for sharing your concern.
As an experienced React developer, I am very interested in this project.

I have checked the Github repository you've shared.
The core modules it has used are React 16.12, redux-thunk and react-bootstrap.
And for routing, current project has used normal react-router.

I have rich practical experience with all of the modules it has used.
As soon as you share JSON file for routing, I can make a reusable component which deals with routing efficiently
I can leverage lazy-loading ( https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html#reactlazy ) to insure better performance and faster loading speed than normal routing.

As I am a veteran in React development, I can understand and enhance the existing React project so quickly while ensuring best performance with maintainable codebase.

If you could share your requirements in more detail with the JSON file, it would be nice.
Thank you.

Hi Leonard
Thanks for sharing your concern.

I have read the requirements and I am reaching out to you with a great interest !
As far as I understood, to be a god candidate for this role, it is important to be familiar with AWS services and to have got experience with React and Material UI.

I have been serving as a full-stack developer for more than 6 years and used several leading softwares in this industry.
I have ever used various AWS services and I am extremely familiar with them such as AWS Lambda, Gateway, DynamoDB, S3, Cognito, SSO and more..
As I am a veteran in React + MUI, I strongly believe that I could fill the role.

If you could give me more brief information about the project such as

1) What library does it use for global state management? ( Redux, Mobx etc )
2) How do you mark the percentage of completion of current project?
3) What software do you use for designing or prototyping wireframes ?

it would be highly appreciated !
Look forward to your response.
Regards.
